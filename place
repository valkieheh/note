hi love
magccollege na tayo. ano na next?

looking back,
imagine all the possibilities. 

if hindi ako pinilit ni rasheed magenroll ng maaga.
if hindi ka tinanong ni mhayang kung ano type mo.
if hindi mo ako always chinachat.
if hindi ako always nagrerespond sa mga chats mo na yon.

pero less on the ways we might not have met, and more on the reasons why we did.
di ko parin masabi in words on how you made my life so much more bearable.

all the moments we've spent together
every second that i'm with you
it always removes the stress from my shoulders
parang nawawala lahat ng problema ko every time na kasama kita
yung pumapasok nalang sa isip ko is you (hehe korni nanaman)

i love na you're always understanding when nagooverthink ako

i appreciate a lot yung note na binigay mo (ilang beses ko na 'to binasa hehe)

and sana as long as we're together.
if we ever get into a misunderstanding, it's always "can we fix this together", and never "ganyan ka nanaman" or "edi wag ka magsalita".

i can't thank you enough for being in my life.
and now that hindi na tayo magkikita often. always remember na you're loved, appreciated, and cherished.
i wish na we can reach our own goals and dreams while maintaining a healthy relationship

bibigay ko rin sana sayo yung fountain pen ko sayo kasabay ng flowers pero wala kasing ink :P
i wanted to give that to you because fountain pens are known to last years and decades of use. and i hope na ganon rin ang relationship natin

i will always dream about that one day na we have our dream jobs, and our own dogs (yung tatlong sabi mo :3)

I love you, baby.

- your kaduo dati sa valo, lover mo na ngayon
